Dusty streets, smoky saloons and the wide of the prairie - this is the home of the cowboy clonk. And of course he must not lack his revolver, his horse and a box full of dynamite.

Also in this pack you will find an Indian tribe complete with camp, weapons, resources, and their own magic and traditions.
