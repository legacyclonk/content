Dlg_Gaho5=What do you mean?
Dlg_Gaho6=I heard some strange sounds coming from the vault lately.
Dlg_Gaho7=But we have to go on. How can we pass this barrier?

Dlg_Harry6=They burnt down almost everything.
Dlg_Harry7=Oh, but we have to go through there.
Dlg_Harry8=They locked the guard tower.
Dlg_Harry9=We just blow it up.

# Sheriff #

Dlg_Sheriff1=A horde of bandits raided our city.
Dlg_Sheriff2=They burnt down almost everything.

Dlg_Sheriff17=Good as new.

Dlg_Sheriff18=Alright, I'll come with you. Let's find that bandit boss.
Dlg_Sheriff19=Now they are not a danger anymore.
Dlg_Sheriff20=But he said you'll never reach the Golden Canyon.
Dlg_Sheriff21=Why not?
Dlg_Sheriff22=You'll have to travel through the abandoned mines.
Dlg_Sheriff23=They are locked with three locks.
Dlg_Sheriff24=Two keys are hidden in this area.
Dlg_Sheriff25=But one of the keys he gave to another bandit.
Dlg_Sheriff26=This one fled into the mountains with a horse, so we can't catch him anymore.
Dlg_Sheriff27=Isn't there another way to get the key back?
Dlg_Sheriff28=There is a small village in the mountains, where a colleague lives.
Dlg_Sheriff29=If I could send him a message, he could stop the bandit.
Dlg_Sheriff30=But for that, the telegraph line must be established again. Here take the plan for poles and wire and see to the connection.
Dlg_Sheriff31=Did you repair the line yet?
Dlg_Sheriff32=Yes, you can send the message.
Dlg_Sheriff32b=No, we are still working on it.
Dlg_Sheriff33=Good, I'll send it immediately.
Dlg_Sheriff34=Have you received the key yet?
Dlg_Sheriff35=Yes, here it is.

Dlg_Dorkan2=Great! My shop looks like new!
Dlg_Dorkan3=Take those 5 bottles of whisky.
Dlg_Dorkan4=Maybe they will come in handy, because some bandits become very cooperative when you have some whisky to offer.
Dlg_Dorkan5=So take those bottles along into the mines.
Dlg_Dorkan6=Thanks, we'll do that.
